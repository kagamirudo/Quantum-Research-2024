This directory contains research and implementation details for applying Grover's algorithm to determine the lexicographically minimal string rotation (LMSR) of a Benzenoid system. It explores the use of quantum computing for chemical structure classification and provides insights into the application of quantum algorithms for combinatorial search problems.
