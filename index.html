            <h4>What is Quantum Computing?</h4>
            <p>This repository contains the research project on Quantum Computing conducted at Drexel University in
                2024. The project explores the potential of quantum mechanics to perform calculations that are beyond
                the capabilities of classical computers.</p>
            <p>Our research delves into the principles of quantum computing, including qubits, superposition, and
                entanglement, and how these principles can be harnessed to solve complex problems more efficiently.</p>
            <p>The project is supervised by Professor Mark Boady and aims to contribute to the growing body of
                knowledge in the field of quantum computing, providing insights and advancements that could shape the
                future of technology.</p>
            <p>We invite you to explore the findings and methodologies detailed in this repository, and we hope it
                serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in the fascinating world of quantum computing.</p>

            <h4>Structure of the Project and Guide for Beginners</h4>
            <p>This section provides an overview of the structure of our quantum computing research project and serves
                as a guide for beginners. It outlines the key components and methodologies used throughout the project.
            </p>
            <p>We start with an introduction to the fundamental concepts of quantum computing, including qubits,
                superposition, and entanglement. These concepts are crucial for understanding the advanced topics
                covered later in the project.</p>
            <p>Next, we delve into the specific research questions we aimed to address, the experimental setup, and the
                data collection methods. This section is designed to help beginners grasp the practical aspects of
                conducting research in quantum computing.</p>

                Feynman
            </blockquote>
            <p>This research project on Quantum Computing has demonstrated the immense potential of this field.
                The insights gained and the advancements made have significantly contributed to our understanding and
                capabilities. This repository will continue to be updated with my ongoing work in quantum computing,
                reflecting new discoveries and developments. I am excited about the future possibilities and am eager to
                continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible with quantum computing.</p>
