# General Introduction of Quantum Computing

### What is a Qubit?

A **qubit** is the fundamental unit of quantum information, analogous to a bit in classical computing. Unlike a classical bit, which can be either 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously, thanks to the principles of quantum mechanics. This property allows quantum computers to process a vast amount of information in parallel, leading to potentially exponential speedups for certain types of computations.

### What is a Quantum Computer?

A **quantum computer** is a type of computer that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations. Unlike classical computers, which use bits as the smallest unit of data, quantum computers use qubits. The unique properties of qubits, such as superposition and entanglement, enable quantum computers to solve complex problems that are currently intractable for classical computers. Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize fields such as cryptography, optimization, and material science by providing solutions to problems that were previously thought to be unsolvable.
